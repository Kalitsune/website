<blockquote>
When you open the box of the not-so-unknown soldier, you come across an image.
According to the description, it's a photo of the freshly enlisted soldier.
You think it would be a nice gesture to send it to his family as a last memento.
Unfortunately, it's been damaged, so you try to repair it before sending it.

## Challenge inspection
The challenge isn't necessarily provided with any file, however, in Unknown Soldier (1) we got a file named `picture_of_me.png`. This file appears to be an image, however there's one small issue: the file is not readable.

This is strange but not unexpected, we're in a challenge of steganography after all. 
I continue my inspection by using `pngcheck` to try to find the issue.
```sh
‚ùØ pngcheck picture_of_me.png 
picture_of_me.png  invalid IHDR image dimensions (25231972x0)
ERROR: picture_of_me.png
```
It appears that the image has invalid dimensions.

## Investigating the issue with the image header
To check what's wrong with the header, you'll need to open the file using an hex editor.

I'm personally using GHex, a GNOME hex editor.

The first line of our file looks like this:
##### <p><span style="color:#c00000">89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A</span> <span style="color:#ffc000">00 00 00 0D</span> <span style="color:#7030a0">49 48 44 52</span> <span style="color:#00b050">01 81 02 64 00 00 00 00 08 06 00 00 00</span> <span style="color:#00b0f0">F7 38 9D 88</span> 00 00 00 04 67</p>

![Meme stressing out that we don't have much time left to solve this challenge](/blog/NBCTF/So%20much%20data%20So%20little%20time.png)

I took the liberty to color the bits of data that are relevant.

Okay so, what are we seeing?

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures, the signature for the PNG file format is <span style="color:#c00000">89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A</span>. Which is  great because that's exactly what we have! This mean that we are indeed looking at a PNG file.

After googling for a bit I also found the [PNG Format Specifications](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Structure.html) according to which, a PNG chunk of data is organised this way:

<span style="color:#ffc000">[Length (4 byte)]</span> <span style="color:#7030a0">[Chunk Type (4 byte)]</span> <span style="color:#00b050">[Data (any)]</span> <span style="color:#00b0f0">[CRC (4 byte)]</span>

The length value is not really useful for now so let's skip it and check what's the chunk type.
I was able to find that the signature of my chunk ( <span style="color:#7030a0">49 48 44 52</span> ), matched the signature of an <span style="color:#7030a0">IHDR</span> Image header.
Which is really interesting because according to the [PNG Format Specs](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html, the <span style="color:#7030a0">IHDR</span> chunk is the one containing the image <span style="color:#00b050">size information</span>.

Let's take a closer look to the data in this chunk then:

| <span style="color:#00b050">DATA</span>  | <span style="color:#00b050">Width</span> | <span style="color:#00b050">Height</span> | <span style="color:#00b050">Bit depth</span> | <span style="color:#00b050">Color type</span> | <span style="color:#00b050">Compression method</span> | <span style="color:#00b050">Filter method</span> | <span style="color:#00b050">Interlace method</span> |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|------------|--------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Bytes |   4   |   4    |     1     |      1     |          1         |       1       |        1         |

In this field we find that the dimensions of this file are indeed corrupted. The rest of the data looks fine.

To fix them we'll have to use the <span style="color:#00b0f0">CRC</span> bytes which allows partial repair in case of damage.

![Always read the docs](/blog/NBCTF/Read%20the%20docs.png)
## Getting the headers dimensions back
As mentioned earlier, the <span style="color:#00b0f0">CRC</span> field may just be able to help us repair this image as it is just like a hash and we only have two values to find.

We'll just have to brute force the Height and Width of the image until we find a <span style="color:#00b0f0">CRC</span> that match:
```py
from binascii import crc32

# Put your CRC as bytes here:
correct_crc = int.from_bytes(b'\xf7\x38\x9d\x88',byteorder='big')

for h in range(2000):
    for w in range(2000):
	    #      IHDR HEADER               WIDTH                        HEIGHT               REMAINING DATA (healthy)
        crc=b"\x49\x48\x44\x52"+w.to_bytes(4,byteorder='big')+h.to_bytes(4,byteorder='big')+b"\x08\x06\x00\x00\x00"
	    # If it match the CRC
        if crc32(crc) % (1<<32) == correct_crc:
            print ('FOUND!')
            print ('Width: ',end="")
            print (hex(w))
            print ('Height :',end="")
            print (hex(h))
            exit()
```

And hooray! We found something:
```txt
FOUND!
Width: 0x181
Height :0x264
```

This mean that by jumping back into the hex editor and editing the Width and Height fields, we can finally fix this image! Let's edit our header right away:
##### <p><span style="color:#c00000">89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A</span> <span style="color:#ffc000">00 00 00 0D</span> <span style="color:#7030a0">49 48 44 52</span> <span style="color:#00b050">00 00 <u>01 81</u> 00 00 <u>02 64</u> 08 06 00 00 00</span> <span style="color:#00b0f0">F7 38 9D 88</span> 00 **00** 00 04 67</p>

![We fixed it!](/blog/NBCTF/fixed.gif)

The only thing left to do is save.

I ran a quick pngcheck just to be sure:
```sh
‚ùØ pngcheck fixed.png 
OK: fixed.png (385x612, 32-bit RGB+alpha, non-interlaced, 55.7%).
```

And everything seemed good! 

I then opened the file and was greeted by this:
![The image obtained](/blog/NBCTF/Unknown%20solider%20fixed.png)

Awesome! We did it! The flag is:
```txt
NBCTF{m0n_b3ll3_un1f0rm3}
```

As we say in french: Champagne!
